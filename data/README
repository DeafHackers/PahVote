Voter Registration static data files
====================================


instructions.yml -- State specific instructions
-----------------------------------------------

This file contains help text of state-specific instructions for filling out
certain fields in the voter registration form.

Each entry corresponds to a particular field in the registration form.

Example:

      - state: AL
        name: id_number
        help_text: Your social security number is requested (by authority of the Alabama Supreme Court 17-4-122)

Each entry must have a state, name, and help_text. The state is the 2-letter
FIPS/USPS abbreviation. The name is the name of the field element in the form.
The help_text is a plain-text string with the instructions for that field.

The list of fields that can currently accept instruction help text are:

 * ethnicity
 * id_number
 * political_party


state_info_en.yml -- Guidelines and information
-----------------------------------------------

This file contains detailed state-specific information regarding things like
registration and ID requirements, early voting details, and same-day
registration.

Structurally, it is composed of entries with a slug, body, title, and children
elements, and the children element can have a list of entries with these same
fields, recursively.

Example:

      - slug: AL
        body: "<p>Some HTML</p>"
        title: Alabama Voter Registration
        children:
        - slug: reg-requirements
          body: "<p>Some more HTML</p>"
          title: Registration Requirements


state_deadlines.en.json -- Deadlines for registration
-----------------------------------------------------

This file is a set of per-state entries describing the deadlines for
registering to vote in each state.

It is a JSON file with a single top-level object, where keys are the 2-letter
FIPS/USPS abbreviation and values are stringified HTML with the text of the
deadline information. For layout purposes, this text should be wrapped in a
<ul><li></li></ul>. TODO: fix this

Example:

      "AL": "<ul><li>Postmarked/hand-delivered by: 11 days before Election Day.</li></ul>",
