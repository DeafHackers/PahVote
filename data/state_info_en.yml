Some additional factors determining residence in DC include: business pursuits or employment, income, residence of family members, leases, and motor vehicle and property registrations.</li>
        <li> If you determine you're a District of Columbia resident, but will not be present in this state or will be away from your home district on Election Day, be sure to check the absentee ballot application requirements and deadlines. In addition, District of Columbia residents who attend school in-state, but in a different election district, may be eligible to register and vote in the election district where they live while attending school. </li>

        Under Florida law, if you've been convicted of a felony and completed all the terms of your sentence (including probation, parole, and the payment of all fines and fees), you may regain your right to register and vote through a process known as the restoration of civil rights. Based on the type of offense for which you were convicted, the process requires either the approval of the governor and/or the state Executive Clemency Board, or, for the most serious offenses, an investigation and hearing.   At the completion of your sentence, the Florida Department of Corrections will automatically submit an electronic application for you to the Florida Parole Commission, which will determine whether you are eligible to have your right to vote restored and, if so, which process you must go through. If your right to vote is restored, you will receive a certificate in the mail at your last known mailing address. This certificate documents your eligibility to register and vote. For more information about having your right to vote restored, visit the <a href="https://fpc.state.fl.us/Clemency.htm">Florida Executive Clemency Board's website</a> or call them at 1-800-435-8286.
