  <div class="span6">
    <p>Internet privacy is PahVote’s number one priority. You can visit www.pahvote.com, without your personal 
    information being revealed to us. The only information that is visible to us is data that we need to use 
    in order to measure website activity. The usage of this knowledge is going to go towards the improvement of the website.</p>
    <p>PahVote may collect personally identifiable data, such as email addresses, names, and so on forth, about visitors 
    when such data is voluntarily submitted to www.pahvote.com to generate voter registration forms. To prevent leaks of 
    sensitive data, PahVote takes every possible step to secure the collection and transmission of sensitive information 
    using industry-accepted standards.</p>
    <p>However, when you submit your voter registration application form to government officials, it usually becomes a 
    matter of public record. This means that anyone who is deemed as having passed the requirements of relevant laws 
    in your State is able to peruse such records.</p>
    <p>PahVote’s Privacy Policy is subject to change. Unless stated otherwise, this policy applies to all information 
    that PahVote holds on its supporters. This privacy policy also will not be changed by PahVote without providing 
    a notice to its supporters in advance, and giving them the opportunity to opt out.</p>
